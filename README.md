ðŸ“Œ Sales Date Prediction â€“ Technical Test
Sales Date Prediction is a technical assessment project that consists of building a complete full-stack application. The objective is to create and manage customer orders and predict when each customer is likely to place their next order based on historical data.

The project is divided into the following components:

Backend (Web API in .NET Core): Exposes REST endpoints to manage customers, employees, shippers, products, and orders. Includes logic to predict the next order date per customer.

Frontend (Angular 17+ SPA): Displays customer data, order history, and a form to create new orders. Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination.

Database (SQL Server): Includes the base schema and additional queries such as views and stored procedures to retrieve and manage data.

D3.js Visualization (Vanilla JS): A small component to build a bar chart from numeric data entered by the user.

This project was built as part of a technical test for a developer position.
